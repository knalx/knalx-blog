My first try of jekyll static site builder.
Looks like it works. You only need to install ruby, gems, and run it.
Now lets try to connect it to [Github Pages][github-pages]

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
